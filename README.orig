The BusinessActivity library and runtime engine is implemented with
eXtended Object Tcl (XOTcl) and can be integrated with applications
providing C or Tcl linkage.

Version 0.2.1 requires: XOTcl version 1.6.6 or higher
	- http://www.xotcl.org
	- http://next-scripting.org/

Unpack the archive in your "/usr/lib" directory or another directory
of your choice (note that the archive unpacks to the
"./BusinessActivitiesLRE-x.y.z" sub-directory when unpacked with 
"tar xvzf BusinessActivitiesLRE-ver-x.y.z.tar.gz").

To run the test cases go to the "./BusinessActivitiesLRE-x.y.z/Activity/tests/" 
subdirectory and type "xotclsh activity-testsuite.xotcl" or 
"tclsh activity-testsuite.xotcl" (make sure that all relevant packages and
libraries are found in the "auto_path")
